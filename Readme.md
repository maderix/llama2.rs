# Llama2 Transformer Model in Rust

This repository contains the Rust implementation of the Llama2 Transformer model, focusing on performance and correctness. The implementation covers model creation, tokenization, and operations such as matrix multiplication and softmax, essential for the transformer's forward pass.

## Features

- Fast matrix multiplication with quantized tensors.
- Efficient softmax implementation.
- Custom tokenizer compatible with pre-trained models.
- Memory-efficient operation utilizing memory mapping.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Llama2 Transformer in Rust, clone the repository and build the project using Cargo.

### Prerequisites

- Rust programming language
- Cargo package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
